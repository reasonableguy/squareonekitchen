                     <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>

                     <li>1 teaspoon dry active yeast</li>
                     <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                     <li>2 cups whole wheat pastry flour</li>
                     <li>1 3/4 – 2 cups all purpose flour, divided</li>
                     <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                     <p>For the Filling</p>
                    <li>1 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
                     <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
                     <li>1/2 cup pecans, chopped</li>
                     <li>1/2 cup dried cranberries, chopped</li>
                     <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
                     <p>For the Glaze</p>
                    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
                     <li>1 tablespoon half and half</li>
                     <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Method</h3>
                  <ol>
                     <li>(Makes 12 large cinnamon rolls)</li>
                     <li>Begin by making the dough. Combine the sourdough starter, warm milk, canola oil, maple syrup,sugar, yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until smooth. Gradually stir in the whole wheat pastry flour and one cup of the all purpose flour. The mixture will be sticky and wet. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until almost doubled (about 1 1/2 – 2 hours).</li>
                     <li>After the dough has risen, gradually stir in the remaining flour and the baking powder. Add just enough that the dough is no longer sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface, and let it rest while you make the filling.</li>
                     <li>Stir together the light brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Melt the butter in a small microwaveable dish. Brush a 9 by 13 inch baking dish or cake pan with the melted butter, and set aside. Reserve the remaining melted butter.</li>
                     <li>Roll out the dough to shape a large rectangle, approximately 18 inches by 12 inches. Generously brush the dough with the melted butter, and sprinkle the brown sugar mixture on top of the melted butter. Add the chopped pecans and dried cranberries on top of the the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.</li>
                     <li>Roll the dough lengthwise to create an 18 inch long spiral of the dough and fillings. Cut the dough into 12 even rolls (each approximately 1 1/2 inches wide), and arrange them cut-side down in the prepared baking dish. Brush any remaining melted butter on top of the rolls.</li>
                     <li>Cover the rolls once again with a damp cloth and allow them to rise while the oven preheats to 375°F.</li>
                     <li>Uncover and bake the cinnamon rolls for about 16 – 18 minutes. The rolls will be puffy and golden on top. Allow the rolls to cool slightly in the pan while you prepare the glaze.</li>
                                       <li>To prepare the glaze, whisk together the powdered sugar, half and half, and maple syrup. To reach the consistency you like, you can add a bit more powdered sugar (about 1 tablespoon at a time) to thicken it a bit, or you can add more half and half (about a teaspoon at a time) to thin the glaze. Drizzle the glaze over the warm rolls in the pan. You can also reserve some of the extra glaze to serve along with the rolls. I find that a small cream pitcher from my coffee set works perfectly for the glaze.</li>
                     <li>The cinnamon rolls are best served warm on the same day. They can also be frozen and reheated at about 250°F until warm and toasty.</li>
